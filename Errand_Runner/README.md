# Capstone Project – Errand Runner API

A Django REST Framework-powered backend API that helps users request errands and get items delivered by available runners. This API is designed to solve a real-life frustration — helping people who can’t visit the market or store get their shopping done through trusted helpers.

# Project Overview
The **Errand Runner API** lets users:
- Register and log in
- Request errands by submitting a list of items
- Track the status of their errands (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Get matched with a runner
- Choose delivery or pickup options

This project was built as a capstone to demonstrate backend skills with Django and REST APIs.
